## About Nambili Samuel
Nambili Samuel was born in Oshikango, Namibia, into a family descended from the Okandjera royal lineage. As a young boy, he grew up surrounded by people who always encouraged him to strive for greatness. He is a trained soldier and physician by profession, with extensive experience in public healthcare and national security. 

One of the most significant events in Nambili Samuel's life was his military training. As a patriot, he was drawn to the idea of serving the Motherland, [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia), and protecting her people. Nambili underwent rigorous training at [Osona military School](https://www.google.com/search?q=at+Osona+military+School&oq=at+Osona+military+School&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCTE0MDE1ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), which instilled in him discipline and a sense of duty. It was during this traditional period from civilian life to the military that he developed a strong commitment and specialized medicine as a professional military career. The military groomed him and taught him the values of discipline, teamwork, and leadership. Through basic military training, he learned the importance of working diligently toward a target goal.

His military experience has been a defining moment in his entire life, instilling in him valuable life lessons that he continues to apply in his everyday life. It also helped him become a disciplined, mature person and a more patriotic citizen.

Throughout his service in the [Namibian Defence Force (NDF)](https://modva.gov.na), Nambili has demonstrated proficiency in Emergency Medicine, Trauma Care, Patient Evacuation ['CASEVAC'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_evacuation), First Aid, [Pharmacology](https://www.ualberta.ca/pharmacology/about/what-is-pharmacology.html), and Primary Health Care. As a combat medic, he was deployed at several military hospitals—**Oshivelo Military Base**, **Grootfontein Military School**, and **Peter Mweshihange Military School** in Windhoek—to provide medical support to fellow service members in the force. Some of his responsibilities include:

- Administering emergency medical treatment and dispersing medicines to members of the armed forces.
- Observing medical procedures, ordering patient referrals, and evacuation.
- Providing primary care services at sick bays, immunizations, and maintaining hygiene.
- Conducting medical assessments and managing illnesses and injuries.

- Collaborating with other civilian healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive patient care in NDF.
- Coordinating a preventative HIV/AIDS program under [PEPFAR](https://na.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/pepfar/)’s pandemic control.

In addition to these duties, Nambili is responsible for general medical treatments and the well-being of members, ensuring they are fit and battle-ready for any operational scenarios. He also plays a critical role in training at Oshivelo Military Base and educating fellow service members on basic first aid and hygiene, enhancing the overall medical readiness of the force. His expertise in pharmacology and [environmental health](https://www.ehinz.ac.nz/indicators/overview/what-is-environmental-health/) allows him to manage and dispense medications effectively, contributing to the well-being and sanitation of personnel under his jurisdiction.
