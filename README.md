## About Me
I was born in Oshikango, Namibia in a strict family and I grew up surrounded by people who always encouraged me to strive for greatness. I am a trained physician with extensive experience in public healthcare. 

One of the most significant events in my life was my military training. As a young man, I was drawn to the idea of serving my country and protecting her people. I underwent rigorous training, courses, and discipline. It was during this time that I developed a strong sense of commitment and dedication as a professional military personnel. Military helped me to learn discipline, teamwork, and leadership. It was through my military training that I learned the importance of sacrifice and how to work towards a target goal.

My military experience has been a defining moment in my life, it taught me valuable life lessons that I continue to apply in my everyday life. It also helped me to become a better leader, a more disciplined person, and a more patriotic citizen.
